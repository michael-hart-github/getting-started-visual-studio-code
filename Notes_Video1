Getting started with VS Code

(Download it)

(Open it)

New File -> Do an intro -> Save -> File type extension (.py)

Note the color of the code changing.

**Note:** I recieved a prompt asking "Do you want ot install the recommended extensions for Python?"

I chose install.

Recieved error message saying Python wasn't installed. Need to install that before I can use the extension effectively.
1. Download Pyton 3.9.4
2. Install now
3. Yes
4. Close

I'm closing VS Code then reopening

Now re-opened

Going to make second python file to see if it works.

Kind of..."No python interpreter is selected. You need to select a python interpreter to enable features such as IntelliSense, linting, and debugging."
1. Select Python interpreter
2. Chose the one listed.
3. Close and re-open again.

Seems to be working now. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Back to the video...

Status bar at bottom. Includes errors/warnings, line number, programming language. Neat.

Left side is activity bar.
1. File explorer
2. Search
3. Source control
4. Run view (run and debug code)
5. Extensions view (Manage and download extensions...like the Pyton one we just had to get!)

View -> Command pallet (The "control center" for all actions in VS Code)

On the welcome page, there's a thing that says "Tools and languages". That brings up the extensions view so you can customize VS Code to cover whatever language you want to use.

Extensions provide support while coding. Auto complete, quick fixes, and formatting.

Extensions **do not** include complilers. That's why we saw the issues before, prompting us to install Python.

Compilers make your code a program...kind of.

Keyboard shortcuts are a - get this - SHORTCUT to doing something!

There's a button on the welcome page to setup all sorts of bindings and keymapping things. (Bindings & keymapping = fancy name for shortcut)

There's a keyboard shortcut cheatsheet you can print off, from the welcome page.

Color themes. Blah blah blah. Turn your potato into an onion.

MULTI

COURSE

~~DRIFTING~~ I mean, EDITING!

End.
