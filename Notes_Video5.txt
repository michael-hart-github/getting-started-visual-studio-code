The wonderful world of debugging

Covering run view, debugging features, and setting "a break point".

Unidentified program

"A sample javascript express app"

I see "Express-demo-app". Not sure where it's from.

You need node.js to run node.js. Who would have thunk it!

Ctrl+shift+D to go to Run view

(If we had access to what she's referencing) Hit F5

VS code attmepts to run the program. If you see a dropdown, you have to choose from the menu option. You would choose node.js

For custom debugging, create a launch configuration.

Gear icon (top left area) -> choose your debugger (node.js) -> vs code makes a launch.json file to a json folder.

Hit add configuration button.

The various parts of your program, and some debugging areas, are in the debugging view. You can filter some of it out with the "overflow menu" by the gear icon.

Breakpoints stop a program at a specific point while executing.
