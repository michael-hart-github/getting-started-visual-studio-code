Keyboard shortcuts come with VS Code. Installing some extensions also add shortcuts to VS Code.

Command Palette is one of the easiest ways to find shortcuts.

Command palette = Ctrl+Shift+P

Type go to file. It lists it as Ctrl+P

File: save, Ctrl+S

etc.

File -> Pref -> Keyboard shortcuts to modify keyboard shortcuts. Neat.

File -> Pref -> Settings to check on settings. Wowowowowowow.

There's a difference between User and Workspace. User = All. Workspace = some. Depends on how things are opened and stuff.

You can change the font size, which is nice, I guess.

Don't forget to turn on sync setting. (profile icon, bottom left)
